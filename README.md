# Multicritical Parameter Planes 

This repository contains an implementation in C of the algorithm devoted descrived in the paper "Computing parameter planes of iterative root-finding methods with several free critical points" to draw parameter planes of rational maps with 2 or more free critial points. 

## Dependencies

Main_libattopng.c uses the library libattopng, a minimal C library to create uncompressed PNG images. It can be downloaded at https://github.com/misc0110/libattopng

## Authors

Beatriz Campos, Jordi Canela, Alberto Rodríguez-Arenas, Purificación Vindel.

## How to cite

When citing this repository, refer to the original paper where the algorithm was presented:
B. Campos, J. Canela, A. Rodríguez-Arenas, P. Vindel, Computing parameter planes of iterative root-finding methods with several free critical points, to appear in Mathematics and Computers in Simulation.
